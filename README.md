You are welcome to do whatever with this
though please change the name


ADDED UPDATES FOR FANTOM:
  - reverse shell support - ADDED
  - sniffer support - ADDED
  - minor changes 
 
PLANNED UPDATES FOR FANTOM:
  - Making the commandline more like plasmas (by Nyx):
      - because in fantom you must be inspecting an ip too run things like sniffer which isnt that great
   
  - fantom will have commands for rented servers:
      - remotely secure servers
      - remotely nuke servers
      - monitor processes
      - prevent new processes
      - logless shell
